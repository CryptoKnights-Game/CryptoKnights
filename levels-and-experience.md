# Levels & Experience

CryptoKnights has a unique leveling system. **Levels (Lv)** and **Experience (XP)** are viewed as scarce assets!

* Only **Ranked Games** give Knights XP.&#x20;
* The higher the XP, the higher the Level of that Knight.
* The matching system will attempt to match Knights with similar Levels.
* Winner gains XP. Loser loses **more** XP.
* When a low Level Knight beats a high one, it earns a lot more XP, and vice versa.
* Player can spend RUBY to restore XP / Level to its **historical max**.
* Player should find it worthwhile to do so because higher Level Knights earn more RUBY.
* XP slowly regenerates when a Knight is not played.
