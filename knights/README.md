# Knights

### Fight with a Knight

Players use Knights to play the game. **All players will be given a free, basic Knight** when they create an account, but those Knights are not NFTs yet.

### Minted Knights can Earn RUBY Rewards

Knights which are NFTs, either won in a Knight Auction, bought from the marketplace, rented from other holders, or newly minted, can **earn RUBY rewards** when they win a Ranked Game. The higher Level a Knight, the more RUBY they earn.

### Owning Multiple Knights

A player can own multiple Knights, all with different Levels and using different items. **Tournaments will have multiple classes** so that all Knights can fight with someone their own size.
