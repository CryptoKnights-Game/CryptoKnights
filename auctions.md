# Auctions

CryptoKnights uses [monet.market](https://monet.market/) to launch all its NFTs.

### NFTs are Revealed Before the Auction

In a monet.market NFT Auction, NFTs are all **revealed before the auction**, and will be arranged based on the value of the NFT, from highest to lowest.

### Bidding

Buyers will **place bids** on those NFTs. The higher the bid, the better the NFT they will receive when auction ends.

If the buyer's bid gets pushed out by other bids, they will be refunded.

### Royalty Pool Auction

Parallel to the NFT Auction, there will also be a **Royalty Pool Auction**. Anyone can participate in the Royalty Pool Auction.

The Royalty Pool collects royalties that come from **sales on the secondary market** and **rent from the rental market**.
