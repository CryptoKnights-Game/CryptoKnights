### PvP Versus

PvP Versus matches players with each other. It is the main way for Knights to level up and earn items. Knights are matched based on their **level**, the **power of their items**, and the **PvP Score of the player**.

The winning Knight earns EXP and can level up; the losing Knight loses EXP! If a Knight loses too much EXP, they cannot play PvP Versus until they recover their EXP to a certain degree.

If a player wins with a CryptoKnight (on-chain Knight), they **earn additional RUBY rewards**. This is one of the "Play & Earn" aspect of the game.

### Story Mode (Campaign)

Story Mode is the **PvE Campaign**. The Knight embarks on an epic journey, defeat enemies, complete challenges, level up, and earn rewards.

Knights that lose too much EXP cannot participate in Story Mode until they recover.
