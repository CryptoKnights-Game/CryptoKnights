### Restore XP

When a Knight is below its All-Time-High Level, the player can consume RUBY to restore the Knight's Level back. The player will do so because a higher Level Knight can gain access to more features in the game and earn more RUBY when they win a ranked game.

### Purchase In-Game Items

RUBY can be consumed to purchase in-game items, similar to how most mobile games provide in-game purchases.

### Mint In-Game Items into NFTs

RUBY can be consumed to mint in-game items in a player's account into NFTs, which can be withdrawn into the player's wallet on the blockchain.

### Stake RUBY to Earn Rewards

Holders can stake RUBY into a single staking pool on the blockchain.

When RUBY are consumed in the game, 60% of that amount will be distributed to RUBY stakers.

### Participate in Auctions

There will be NFT Auctions that will be priced in RUBY. Therefore a player must possess RUBY in order to participate in those Auctions.

### Participate in Royalty Pools

For Auctions priced in RUBY, the corresponding Royalty Pool will be priced in RUBY as well. Therefore a player must possess RUBY in order to participate in those Auctions.
