# Game Assets

Since the game runs on a centralized server, assets are controlled by the server when used in game, similar to how a centralized exchange will control your coins when you deposit them to trade.

Therefore game assets exist on two layers:

### Server Layer

* Hosts **Off-Chain Assets**:
  * Cannot be minted or withdrawn to the player’s wallet.
  * Behave similar to traditional game items.
* Hosts **On-Chain Assets**:
  * Can be moved (or, “**bridged**”) between the Server Layer and the Blockchain Layer.&#x20;

### Blockchain Layer

* Only **On-Chain Assets** exist on the Blockchain Layer as ERC tokens.
* Player has **full control** over these assets with their crypto wallet.
