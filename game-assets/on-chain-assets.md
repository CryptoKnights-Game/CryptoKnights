# On-Chain Assets

On-Chain Assets can be withdrawn from the game to the player's crypto wallet. The player would do so in order to:

* List the items on the marketplace for sale
* Exchange items with friends
* Use the assets as DeFi instruments

On-Chain Assets include:

### Knights

Knights are the core asset in the whole game.

A player can own multiple Knights and choose which to fight with.

With NFT Knights (Minted Knights, On-Chain Knights), a player can earn RUBY when they win a game.

### Armors

The items that increase a Knight's defense.

There are 5 types of Armors:

* Helmet
* Armor (breastplate)
* Gauntlets
* Waist
* Boots

### Weapons

The items that increase a Knight's attack.

There are 3 types of Weapons:

* Long Sword

### Cards

Cards are the moves a Knight can perform during a battle.

There are 5 types of Cards, categorized by their background color:

* **Red**: Attack

### Skins

Skins are used to change the appearance of a Knight and don't affect gameplay.

There are skins for each type of Weapons and Armors, therefore:

* Full Armor (full set of skin)
* Helmet
* Armor (breastplate)
* Gauntlets

* Boots
* Long Sword
* Sword & Shield

3rd party artists will be able to create their own NFT skins and sell on our marketplace in future expansions.

### Emotes

Emotes are the dances a Knight can perform when they win a match.

They are used to humiliate the other player, which is what video games are all about.

3rd party artists will be able to create their own NFT emotes and sell on our marketplace in future expansions.

### Battle Replay

A Battle Replay is the recording of a fight. Players can share their Battle Replay with each other.

We expect to see legendary Battle Replays becoming highly valuable over time.

### RUBY

RUBY is the main currency in the game. See $RUBY page.
